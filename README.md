## ✇ Test drive

> **Heads Up 🖐🏻**
>
> In order to try [Thunder Network](https://thunder-network.github.io/), you'll require two instances of web3 with different public addresses.
>
> i.e. Two different Ethereum public addresses. Use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), etc in two different browsers/tabs)

1. Open https://thunder-network.github.io/ with two different users (see note above)
> Do not write anything in USER1's form. We will use USER2's form to initiate the process.
2. Copy USER1's Ethereum public address to USER2's **To Ethereum Address** field and enter the amount ( the maximum net amount you can transfer) in **Amount** field of USER2.
3. **[REQUIRES GAS]** Click on **Start** button on USER2's screen and it will deploy the contract and wait till it gets mined.
4. After ~14 seconds, you can see the change on the screen of both users.
5. **[NO GAS]** Send some micro amount from USER2 to USER1 via the panel.
6. **[NO GAS]** USER1 can also send back the amount to USER1.
7. **[NO GAS]** Eat Sleep Rave/*Send* Repeat!
8. **[REQUIRES GAS]** When you wish to settle, click on **Settle** button. This will initiate a transaction which will write the final ledger on Blockchain.
9. Thank you for trying!
